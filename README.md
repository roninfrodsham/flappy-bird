# Flappy Bird

This is a flappy bird clone was made with JavaScript to get myself more familiar with the `Canvas API` and `requestAnimationFrame`.

It's a pretty simple engine and works great in JS by using `requestAnimationFrame` to call functions to update the positions of the sprites before the next paint.

The trickiest part to understand was the collision detection. There is a great explanation on the subject (here)[https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/rect-rect.php].

### Gameplay

The aim of the game is navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes. To move the bird up use the `space, x or arrow up` keys or click the mouse or tap the screen on mobile.

It's a notoriously difficult game but great fun and highly addictive.

### Run the game

To run the game just open the `index.html` file in your browser or run the files in server.
