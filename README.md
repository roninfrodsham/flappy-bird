# Flappy Bird JavaScript

This is a flappy bird clone made with JavaScript to get more familiar with the canvas.

It's a pretty simple engine and works great in JS by using `requestAnimationFrame` to call functions to update the positions of the sprites before the next paint.

### Gameplay

The aim of the game is navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes. To move the bird up use the `space, x or arrow up` keys or click the mouse or tap the screen on mobile.

It's a notoriously difficult game but great fun and highly addictive.

### Run the game

To run the game just open the `index.html` file in your browser or run the files in server.
